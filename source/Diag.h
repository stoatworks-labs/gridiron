/**
    Logging for a plugin that lives inside somebody else's process.

    A small member of the fleet's `diag` family, carried from orrery. The rest of
    the repos get a rotating log, a crash report and a diagnostics bundle; an
    FFGL plugin gets only the log, for two reasons:

    - **No crash handler.** A plugin loaded into Resolume must not install a
      process-wide signal handler. It would intercept faults that are not ours
      and interfere with the host's own handling. A plugin has no business
      deciding what happens when Resolume dies.
    - **No bundle command.** There is no UI to hang one off -- a plugin is a
      list of sliders in someone else's inspector.

    ## Why this exists here, specifically

    gridiron v0.1.0 shipped with no logging at all, and the first outside bug
    report (gridiron#1, a black wall in Resolume on Windows) arrived with
    "Doesn't seem to create a log file" in the box that asks for one. That
    reporter was right, and the report could not be answered from the evidence
    because there was none to give.

    Every way this plugin fails looks identical from the operator's side -- a
    black clip -- and the causes are not distinguishable without saying which
    one happened:

    - **The folder was never read.** Wrong path, an empty folder, or a folder of
      files this build cannot decode. Logged with the path as the host gave it,
      the count found, and the count that survived decoding.
    - **The atlas would not upload.** A real refusal by the GPU, or -- until it
      was fixed -- an error some *other* plugin left in the queue. Logged with
      the size, the layer count, the megabytes asked for and the GL error.
    - **A shader would not compile.** The vendor, renderer and version strings go
      next to it, because a shader that builds on one machine and not another is
      a driver answer, not a source answer.
    - **The host clock unit.** Resolume sends milliseconds and an offline harness
      sends seconds; the fleet has paid for that confusion twice. What the clock
      settled on is stated outright rather than inferred from a code read.

    ## Rate

    `ProcessOpenGL` runs fifty times a second. Nothing here is called from a
    per-frame path except through `stateChanged`, which logs a *transition* --
    so a wall that is black for an hour writes one line, not 180,000.
