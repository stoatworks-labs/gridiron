/**
    A hash, for the seeded arrangement.

    Integer in, float out, deterministic, and cheap. It is not a good hash in
    any cryptographic sense and does not need to be -- the only property asked
    of it is that consecutive copy indices give uncorrelated positions, which
    is exactly what a plain LCG fails at and this passes.

    It runs on the **CPU only**. There is no GLSL twin, because a wall is at most
    a few hundred cells and the fill is solved when the folder or the seed
    changes rather than once per frame, let alone once per pixel. That is the
    reason this file has no `//= mirrored` markers anywhere: there is one copy of
    the arithmetic, and the harness tests the real one.

    **This is what makes the wall reproducible.** Same folder, same seed, same
    arrangement -- across a reload, across a machine, across the gap between the
    wall the client approved and the wall that goes up on the night.
