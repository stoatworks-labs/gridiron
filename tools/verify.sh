# !!! NOT YET GRIDIRON'S CHECKS !!!
#
# This file is flipbook's verify.sh with the names swept. The check list below
# describes flipbook's sheet playback, not gridiron's wall. It is retained only
# for its bones -- the registration check, the lipo check and the OFX plist /
# codesign check are the ones the copy-traps note says must stay local -- and it
# must be rewritten against gridiron's own checks before it means anything.
#
# Until then a pass here is not evidence about this plugin.
#
# Everything, in the order that fails fastest.
#
# Each check answers a question none of the others can:
#
#   --frames      does the cell on screen match Playback.cpp, across all three
#                 modes and a run that wraps off the end of the sheet
#   --copies      did every copy land where Placement.cpp said, showing the
#                 frame the stagger said
#   --aspect      does a square cell stay square, and the right size, off 1:1
#   --seam        does any cell bleed into its neighbour under either filter
#   --key         do the four key modes do four different things
#   --presets     does every factory preset put its copies on the raster
#   sweep.py      does every control actually reach the picture
#   registration  does each bundle contain exactly its own plugin
#   lipo          is the macOS build really universal
#

# itself from a file-scope constructor and nothing references it by name, so a
# linker that drops the translation unit gives a bundle which loads, exports
# plugMain, and reports that it contains no plugins. Resolume shows an empty
# effects list and no error.
#
# It also catches the opposite mistake -- putting a registration in the shared
# library, which registers BOTH plugins into BOTH bundles.
